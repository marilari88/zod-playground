# Zod Playground

Zod Playground is a web app that allows users to interact with the Zod library API. Users can define schemas and test the validation of given values. The app is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. It is a great tool for developers who are working with the Zod API and want to test their code on the fly without having to set up Zod locally.
